# meteor-facebook-app
A small working meteor app showcasing login with Facebook, search and page posts retrieval and display. Please take into account that this works only with Facebook pages (not places or normal accounts), you can customize the fbgraph queries to what you need.

# Running the application
First you need to go to the server/lib/social-config.js file and put your Facebook app ID and secret. After this simply run it as any meteor app and access it at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
